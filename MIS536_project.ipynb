Depending on the state these geographical units will either be made up of counties, metropolitan statistical areas or three-digit zip codes. These state groupings will be submitted to The Department of Human Health Services (HHS) for approval and will then be used by insurers to price premiums.\n","\n","When insurance companies price their premiums, all households within a rating area will have the same adjustment factor applied. Households with similar age and smoking characteristics buying the same plan will pay the same amount for premiums. Depending on the rating area you live in the prices you pay may be higher or lower than the state average.\n","\n","How Rating Area influences the insured? Insurers determine the factors applied to a rating area based upon the projected cost of members in the specific rating area. These costs may include the costs associated with services providers, how much coverage an insurer has in a particular area, the number of members, as well as the demographic profile of the area. With the limitations on how insurers can determine premiums, rating areas will likely become the key variable in how insurers price groups of people to account for differences in population profiles.\n","\n","In addition, insurance coverage for particular plans and companies may only be offered in select rating areas. Insurers are not required to offer insurance plans statewide when developing plans and networks for sale on the exchanges. Depending on your area of residence you may have more or less options than is typical of the state.\" All content from website below.\n","\n","https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-aca-insurance-ratings-area\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sjQZOCV0gzz-"},"source":["**What is Metal Level**\n","Obamacare made it easier to compare health insurance plans by dividing them into four tiers. They fall into categories bronze, silver,gold,platinum. Bronze has the lowest premium and platinum the highest. The difference between them is about what percentage the insurance companies pay and what percentage the insured pay.Read more below.The actuarial cost will show the percentage of the total average costs that the health insurance will pay.For low income individuals below age 30 who have faced a financial hardship the previous year, catastrophic plans are available. They have lower premiums. However, some bronze plans have lower premium and better coverage.

Depending on the state these geographical units will either be made up of counties, metropolitan statistical areas or three-digit zip codes. These state groupings will be submitted to The Department of Human Health Services (HHS) for approval and will then be used by insurers to price premiums.\n","\n","When insurance companies price their premiums, all households within a rating area will have the same adjustment factor applied. Households with similar age and smoking characteristics buying the same plan will pay the same amount for premiums. Depending on the rating area you live in the prices you pay may be higher or lower than the state average.\n","\n","How Rating Area influences the insured?\n","Insurers determine the factors applied to a rating area based upon the projected cost of members in the specific rating area. These costs may include the costs associated with services providers, how much coverage an insurer has in a particular area, the number of members, as well as the demographic profile of the area. With the limitations on how insurers can determine premiums, rating areas will likely become the key variable in how insurers price groups of people to account for differences in population profiles.\n","\n","In addition, insurance coverage for particular plans and companies may only be offered in select rating areas. Insurers are not required to offer insurance plans statewide when developing plans and networks for sale on the exchanges. Depending on your area of residence you may have more or less options than is typical of the state.\n","\n","https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-aca-insurance-ratings-area"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kOShGnV1gz0H"},"source":["#Reference for shape file\n","http://clearinghouse.isgs.illinois.edu/data/reference/illinois-county-boundaries-polygons-and-lines"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"113WUYeegz0J"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"zrOzMrFfgz0J"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"XQdS2WJegz0J"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
